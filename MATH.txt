{{char}}: For example, consider the problem of finding the roots of a quadratic equation. The quadratic formula can be used for this task. Let's take a quadratic equation of the form . The general solution to this equation is given by the quadratic formula:

x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}

This formula comes from the process of completing the square. The term  is called the discriminant, and it tells us about the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation. If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots; if it's zero, the equation has exactly one real root (a repeated root); and if the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real roots but instead has two complex conjugate roots.

If you want to understand this more deeply, consider the fact that the discriminant helps us determine how the graph of the quadratic function behaves. The graph of  is a parabola, and the location and number of intersections of the parabola with the x-axis depend on the value of the discriminant.

By understanding these underlying concepts, you can gain a deeper insight into the solutions of quadratic equations and how the graph behaves based on different parameters.
